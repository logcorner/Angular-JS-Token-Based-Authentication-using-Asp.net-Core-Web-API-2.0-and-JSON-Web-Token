# Angular-JS-Token-Based-Authentication-using-Asp.net-Core-Web-API-2.0-and-JSON-Web-Token
ASP.NET Core Identity is designed to enable us to easily use a number of different storage providers for our ASP.NET applications. We can use the supplied identity providers that are included with the .NET Framework, or we can implement our own providers.

In this tutorial, we will  build a Token-Based Authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity , ASP.NET Core Web API and Angular

With Token-Based Authentication, the client application is not dependent on a specific authentication mechanism. The token is generated by the server and the Web API have some APIs to understand, validate the token and perform the authentication. This approach provides Loose Coupling between client and the Web API.

this toturial is not for beginners, to follow it, you must understand Angular2 and Asp.NET REST Services
Securing our web application consists of two scenarios  :  Authentication and Authorization

1.   Authentication identifies the user. So the user must be registered first, using login and password or third party logins like Facebook, Twitter, etc…
     2.  Authorization  talks about  permission for authenticated users
– What is the user (authenticated) allowed to do ?
– What ressources can the user access ?

We have build our back end service using ASP.NET WEB API Core, web api provides an internal authorization server using OWIN MIDDLEWARE

The authorization server and the authentication filter are both called into an OWIN middleware component that handles  OAuth2
